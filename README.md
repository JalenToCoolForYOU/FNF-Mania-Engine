# Friday Night Funkin' - Super Engine! (Early Development Stage!)

This is the repository for Friday Night Funkin' 0.2.2 Engine, a game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop" by Ninjamuffin99 and the Funkin' devs.
Huge credits to them for the base game!

Just want to note, ALL settings default to off upon first launch, including visible score text, you'll have to enable them in options
