# Friday Night Funkin' - Mega Engine! (Early Development Stage!)

This is the repository for Friday Night Funkin' Mega Engine, a game originally made for Ludum Dare 47 "Stuck In a Loop" by Ninjamuffin99 and the Funkin' devs.
Huge credits to them for the base game!

Just want to note, ALL settings default to off upon first launch, including visible score text, you'll have to enable them in options

The engine was called 0.2.2 Engine, then Super Engine, before I finally settled with Mega Engine, just to clear any confusion about release names, starting from the next public release, it'll be under the name Mega Engine!
